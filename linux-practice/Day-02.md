## üñ•Ô∏è What is a Computer?

A **computer** is a device that has an **IP address**.

Examples of computers include:

* **Laptop**
* **Mobile**
* **Chip**
* **TV**
* **Server**

The **purpose** of the device determines its classification. For instance:

* **Server**: Used to host applications or services.
* **Mobile**: Used to access and run applications.

In short, a device with essential components like:

* **RAM**
* **Operating System (OS)**
* **Processor**
* **Hard Drive (HD)**

...is classified as an **IP device**.

## üñß Client-Server Architecture

### Server:

* A **server** is a computer that provides services, data, or resources to other computers.
* Example: A doctor (server) providing a diagnosis or treatment to a patient (client).

### Client:

* A **client** is a computer that requests data or services from the server.
* Example: A patient (client) asking for a diagnosis from a doctor (server).

In simpler terms:

* **Server**: Provides services (like hosting websites or databases).
* **Client**: Requests services (like browsing a website or querying a database).

### Connecting to a Server:

To connect to a server, the following are required:

1. **Protocol** (e.g., SSH for secure communication)
2. **Port Number**
3. **IP Address**
4. **Username & Password**

### Tools to Connect to Servers:

We use **SSH clients** to connect to servers. Some examples include:

* Gitbash
* Mac Terminal
* Windows Command Prompt
* Mobaxterm
* Putty
* SuperPutty

## üîë Key Pair Generation

To securely connect to a server, you need an **SSH key pair**. This is used to authenticate the client to the server.

### Key Pair Generation Command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f <file_name>
```

For example:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f demokey
```

This generates two files:

1. **Public Key**: `demokey.pub` (Uploaded to the server)
2. **Private Key**: `demokey` (Kept secret and used for connection)

In **AWS**, upload the **public key** in the **key pairs** section of the instance and use the **private key** to connect.

### Connect to Server from Terminal:

```bash
ssh -i <private_key> ec2-user@<public_ip>
```

Example:

```bash
ssh -i demokey ec2-user@54.234.59.12
```

## üêß Linux

### Introduction:

* **Linux** was introduced by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**.
* It is **not an Operating System (OS)** but rather the **kernel** that interacts with hardware.
* **Linux** is **open-source**, which means anyone can modify and distribute it.

### What is an Operating System (OS)?

* An **Operating System** is a combination of:

  1. **Kernel** (the core component that interacts with hardware)
  2. **User Interface (UI)** (the interface that users interact with)

In essence, the **Linux kernel** plus a **UI** makes up a **Linux OS**.

### Types of Linux Operating Systems:

There are several **distributions** (distros) of Linux, and each of them may include the Linux kernel along with a specific set of applications and services.

Some popular Linux distros include:

* **Red Hat** (RHEL): Paid service version, but the code is open-source.
* **Ubuntu**: Free and open-source, user-friendly.
* **Fedora**: Free and open-source, community-driven.
* **SUSE**: Free and open-source, designed for enterprise use.
* **Oracle Linux**: Free, enterprise-grade.
* **Amazon Linux**: Optimized for AWS cloud environments.
* **Debian**: A widely used free and open-source Linux distro.
* **Kali Linux**: A distro focused on security testing.
* **Solaris**: A Unix-based OS, used mainly for enterprise environments.

### Difference Between Some Distros:

* **Red Hat**: The kernel + UI combination; service requires a paid subscription (Red Hat Enterprise Linux - RHEL).
* **Debian**: The kernel + UI combination; free and open-source.
* **Other Distros**: Most Linux distros are variations with either free or paid services but share the same underlying Linux kernel.
