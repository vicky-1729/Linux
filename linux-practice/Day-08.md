# DAY-08  
## Project # ü§ñ Roboshop Project

---

We will build this project with the following details every time:

- **AMI:** devops-practice  
- **User Name:** ec2-user  
- **Password:** DevOps321  *(use this user and password)*

---

### üë§ System/Service User

System or service users are non-human users used to run applications.

- These users **do not** have login access.  
- We will create a system user for all microservices using:

```bash
useradd --system --home /app --shell /sbin/nologin --comment "roboshop system user" roboshop
````

This command creates:

* User: `roboshop`
* Home Directory: `/app`
* Shell: `nologin` (no login access)

---

### üîê Password Storage

* Passwords are stored encrypted in `/etc/shadow`.

---

### üìÇ Application Directory

* All application code (e.g., `catalogue`) will be placed in: `/app`

---

### üì¶ Software Installation

You can install some packages directly:

```bash
dnf install nginx
dnf install mongodb-org
```

But microservices like `catalogue` or `user` **cannot** be installed directly, since we build them from scratch.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Programming Languages & File Types

| Language | File Extension |
| -------- | -------------- |
| NodeJS   | `.js`          |
| Java     | `.java`        |
| Python   | `.py`          |
| Go       | `.go`          |

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Tools

Build tools help to:

* Compile code
* Download dependencies
* Prepare the app to run

| Language | Build Tool | Build File           |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| NodeJS   | `npm`      | `package.json`       |
| Java     | `maven`    | `pom.xml`            |
| Python   | `pip`      | `requriements.txt`   |
| go lang  | `go`       | `.go`

*Every programming language has dependencies or libraries.*

For example, to install dependencies in NodeJS:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all dependencies.

---

#### üîÑ Common Steps for All Microservices

1. Install the programming language runtime
2. Create the application directory
3. Create the system user
4. Download the code
5. Install dependencies

Let me know if you want me to help with systemd service files or anything else!

```

If you want, I can also prepare a sample `catalogue.service` systemd file example to go with this. Just say the word!
