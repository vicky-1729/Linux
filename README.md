# Linux System Administration & Deployment Framework

## Executive Summary

This repository houses enterprise-grade Linux administration resources and deployment architecture documentation for the RoboShop microservices platform. The materials are structured to provide a comprehensive foundation in Linux systems administration while offering practical implementation experience with distributed application architecture.

## Repository Architecture

The framework is organized into two primary components:

### [Linux Administration Curriculum](./linux-practice/)

A systematic progression of Linux system administration modules, structured to build enterprise-level competency:

| Module | Focus Area | Key Learning Objectives |
|--------|------------|-------------------------|
| [Foundation](./linux-practice/Day-02.md) | System Fundamentals | Computing architecture, resource management principles |
| [Command Interface](./linux-practice/Day-03.md) | Shell Operations | File system navigation, command syntax patterns |
| [File Management](./linux-practice/Day-04.md) | Content Operations | Data manipulation, text processing workflows |
| [Access Control](./linux-practice/Day-05.md) | Security Framework | User provisioning, permission hierarchy implementation |
| [Package Ecosystem](./linux-practice/Day-06.md) | Application Management | Repository configuration, service deployment patterns |
| [Process Control](./linux-practice/Day-07.md) | Runtime Management | Resource allocation, performance monitoring methodologies |
| [Network Infrastructure](./linux-practice/Day-08.md) | Communication Systems | Protocol implementation, connectivity troubleshooting |
| [Advanced Operations](./linux-practice/Day-09.md) | Enterprise Administration | System optimization, integration architecture |

### [RoboShop Microservices Implementation](./linux-roboshop-manual/)

#### Frontend Tier
- [Web Interface](./linux-roboshop-manual/frontend.MD): Nginx implementation with reverse proxy configuration

#### Application Services
- [Catalogue Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/catalogue.MD): Product inventory management system
- [User Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/user.MD): Authentication and profile management framework
- [Cart Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/cart.MD): Transaction state management system
- [Shipping Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/shipping.MD): Logistics calculation and management
- [Payment Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/payment.MD): Transaction processing system
- [Dispatch Service](./linux-roboshop-manual/dispatch.MD): Order fulfillment management

#### Data Persistence Layer
- [MongoDB](./linux-roboshop-manual/mongodb.MD): Document-oriented persistence for product and user data
- [Redis](./linux-roboshop-manual/redis.MD): In-memory data structure store for session management
- [MySQL](./linux-roboshop-manual/mysql.MD): Relational database system for transactional records

#### Message Orchestration
- [RabbitMQ](./linux-roboshop-manual/rabbitmq.MD): Advanced message queuing protocol implementation
